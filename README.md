1.Builds a binary tree from a given level-order representation and calculates the *minimum number of phones* required so that every node is either equipped with a phone or directly connected to a node with one.

2.Generates the first N prime numbers (where N is the number of phones found in the first step), and counts how many XOR pairs of these primes fall *outside* a given range [L, R].

3. Prime Number Generation
The program then generates the first m prime numbers, where m is the result from Step 2. A simple primality test (isPrime) is used to identify primes.

4.XOR Pair Counting
For every *unique pair of primes*, the program computes their XOR value.
It counts how many XOR results *fall outside* the given range [L, R].

->Data structure used are queue and tree.
